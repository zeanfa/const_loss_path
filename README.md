# const_loss_path
This repository contains code for experiments on constant loss path finding

Used pytorch-cifar10 code from [here](https://github.com/soapisnotfat/pytorch-cifar10)

`train_models.py` script is used to train initial models

`train_optimal_segments.py` is used to train the model for bend point of the curve

`connect_curve_and_seg.py` is used for plots drawing
